remotes::install_github("valentingar/seepr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(seepr)
mydat %>%
  seepr_dat(depths = mydepths) %>%
  fit_dhr(s = 24*60) %>% # minute data
  flux(n = 0.39, 
       Cscal = 0.5,
       Cwcal = 1,
       Kcal = 0.0058,
       method = "keery_amplitude")
## basic example code
```
